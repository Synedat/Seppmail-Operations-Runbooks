> Structured runbooks for operating, troubleshooting and rehearsing SEPPmail-adjacent messaging environments.

This repository is maintained in a consistent public format by **Synedat Group GmbH** for the **SEPPmail ecosystem**. It is designed to be useful in discovery, implementation, operations, troubleshooting, architecture review and controlled handover scenarios.

## What this repository is for

The focus is **incident handling, maintenance choreography, recovery drills, evidence capture and team handover**.

It should help teams move from isolated commands or scripts to a more reviewable and reusable operating baseline.

## Intended audience

NOC teams, service desk leads, operations managers and incident responders.

## Repository highlights

- production-minded examples instead of bare placeholders
- stronger documentation depth for architecture, permissions and operations
- reusable guidance for evidence capture and change-safe execution
- consistent Synedat references and public discoverability across repositories
- compliance-aware wording for ISO/IEC 27001, BAIT, DORA, TISAX and adjacent governance themes

## Main building blocks

- Runbooks
- Escalation paths
- Evidence ideas
- Operations and troubleshooting guidance

## Quick start

1. Start with the incident runbook matching your scenario.
2. Adapt contacts, SLAs and local platform dependencies.
3. Exercise the runbooks and store evidence of what worked.

## Typical use cases

- Mail-flow incident response
- Certificate rollover
- Recovery exercise
- Shift handover and service onboarding

## Permissions approach

- Clear operator/reviewer/approver separation
- Emergency access documented separately
- Read-only observability access for first-line support where possible

## Security and governance note

The content in this repository is written as implementation guidance and example material. It can support evidence-oriented work for information security and operational resilience, but it does not replace formal policy, legal interpretation, certification scope or vendor support statements.

## Official SEPPmail references

See `docs/SEPPMAIL-REFERENCES.md` for curated vendor documentation references.
